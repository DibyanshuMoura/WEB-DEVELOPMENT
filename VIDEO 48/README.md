I found out that the series from which I'm learning MERN stack from is incomplete and its not going to be, so I had to find another series in youtube and I found the one of codewithharry and I was just revising stuff of html and css like animation and covered some smaller topics like filter. The file fromat will change to VIDEO as the series has changed and yeah I'll revise stuff for now and post with learning JS.
